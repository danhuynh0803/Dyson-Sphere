Template scripts that may need some modification,
but for the most part, can be used right away.

Currently includes:

1) Enemy class, spawner using text, and enemy pathing.
2) Framework for spawning nodes in a grid. Nodes will need some modification to fit project.
3) General GUI controls for buttons and most menu applications
4) Sound controller and audio pitch change to match Time.timescale (to make BGM sound slower or faster)
5) Dialog controller to work with the enemy spawner and RPG talk.
    - This controller can coordinate enemy spawn waves with which dialog
    - Currently no functionality to have dialog appear at the SAME time an enemy spawns.
5) Misc scripts like a camera movement, shake, etc
